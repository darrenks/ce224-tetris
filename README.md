# Collaborative Tetris AI

To run use

    python3 main.py

## Args

`ai` use ai to play rather than keyboard arrows + `a` and `f`
`2` search to a depth of 2
`<name>` use that person's eval function
`kind` generate the piece that can give the highest eval instead of random
`evil` generate the piece that has the worst possible eval instead of random

Depth 2 max/vann survived for about 10000 placements (equivalent of level 400) on my run.
